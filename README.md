# Food and Nutrition Security Survey November 2023

## Overview
The Rockefeller Foundation ran a nationwide survey on Food and Nutrition Security in the Asian American and Native Hawaiian Pacific Isander (AA & NHPI) population. The nationwide study was conducted by The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research using the Amplify AAPI Monthly survey drawing from NORC’s Amplify AAPI® Panel designed to be representative of the U.S. Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander household population. Online and telephone interviews were offered in English, the Chinese dialects of Mandarin and Cantonese, Vietnamese, and Korean with 1,115 Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders aged 18 and older living in the United States. The margin of sampling error is +/- 4.4 percentage points.
