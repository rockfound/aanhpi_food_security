# Food and Nutrition Security Survey November 2023

## Overview
The Rockefeller Foundation ran a nationwide survey on Food and Nutrition Security in the Asian American and Native Hawaiian Pacific Isander (AA & NHPI) population. The nationwide study was conducted by The AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research using the Amplify AAPI Monthly survey drawing from NORC’s Amplify AAPI® Panel designed to be representative of the U.S. Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander household population. Online and telephone interviews were offered in English, the Chinese dialects of Mandarin and Cantonese, Vietnamese, and Korean with 1,115 Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders aged 18 and older living in the United States. The margin of sampling error is +/- 4.4 percentage points. 

## About the Survey
- **Conducted**: November 6, 2023 – November 15, 2023
- **Themes**: Food security, nutrition security, and access to SNAP benefits
- **Sample size**: 1,115

## How we identified food security status:
Food security is calculated based on the [USDA 6-item survey standards](https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-u-s/survey-tools). These questions are represented in Q1 to Q6 of our survey. We followed the USDA guideline for scoring food security status:

- Raw score 0-1—High or marginal food security (raw score 1 may be considered marginal food security, but a large proportion of households that would be measured as having marginal food security using the household or adult scale will have raw score zero on the six-item scale)

- Raw score 2-4—Low food security

- Raw score 5-6—Very low food security

For our reporting purposes, the food security status of households with raw score 0-1 is described as food secure and the two categories “low food security” and “very low food security” in combination are referred to as food insecure.


## How we identified nutrition security status:
Nutrition security is calculated based on the [Tufts University nutrition security screener question](https://tuftsfoodismedicine.org/project/nss). These questions are represented in Q7 and Q8 of our survey. We followed Tuft University's guideline for scoring nutrition security status:

- While the optimal scoring of the NSS requires more research, one possibility is to define low nutrition security as responses of “somewhat hard", "hard", or "very hard" to the question "Thinking about the last 12 months, how hard was it for you or your household to regularly get and eat healthy foods?"
